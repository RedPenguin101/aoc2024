input is rows of integers

a row is OK if both of the following are true
 - monotonically increasing or decreasing
 - absolute deltas are between 1 and 3 inclusive

7 6 4 2 1 is OK, because monotonic increase and deltas are in bounds
 1 2 2 1

1 2 7 8 9 is not OK, because one delta is > 3
 1 5 1 1

1 3 2 4 5 is not OK, because not monotonically increasing

Part 2:

if removing a single number would make it OK, it is OK.
